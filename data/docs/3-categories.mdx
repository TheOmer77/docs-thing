Categories are labels that can be used as a way to group and organize pages based on their content or purpose.

Categories and their display names can be defined in `data/config.json`. The `categories` field in this file is an object where keys are category IDs, and their values are the display names shown to the user.

Each page can be assigned a category - this is done by setting the `category` field of the page to the desired category ID. If a page does not have a `category` field, or its category value isn't one of the category IDs defined in `data/config.json`, it is considered uncategorized and displayed at the top of the sidebar.

For example, with the following page and configuration, the page will be displayed in the sidebar under the "Getting started" category:

```md title="docs/installation.mdx"
---
title: Installation
category: getting-started
---
```

```json title="data/config.json"
{
  "categories": {
    "getting-started": "Getting started"
  }
}
```
