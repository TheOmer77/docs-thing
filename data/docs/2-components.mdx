## Alerts

Alerts are an extension of the blockquote syntax that you can use to emphasize critical information, working similarly to [how they do on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). To turn a blockquote into an alert, simply start it with the correct prefix for the type you want.

### Info alerts

For info alerts, use the `[!INFO]` prefix.

> [!INFO]
> This is an alert with some info.

> [!INFO] Note
>
> There should be some important info here. Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with any.

```md
> [!INFO]
> This is an alert with some info.

> [!INFO] Note
>
> There should be some important info here. Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with any.
```

### Danger alerts

For danger alerts, use the `[!DANGER]` prefix.

> [!DANGER]
> This is an alert with a warning or negative message.

> [!DANGER] Warning!
>
> This is the most dangerous alert you have ever seen. But not really.

```md
> [!DANGER]
> This is an alert with a warning or negative message.

> [!DANGER] Warning!
>
> This is the most dangerous alert you have ever seen. But not really.
```

## Cards

Cards can be used as links to other pages, organized in a grid. Each card includes a title and an optional description.

<Cards>
  <Card
    title='Markdown test'
    description='Just some random text to test markdown features.'
    href='/sample/markdown-test'
  />
  <Card
    title='MDX test'
    description='Same as markdown test but specifically for testing MDX components.'
    href='/sample/mdx-test'
  />
</Cards>

```mdx
<Cards>
  <Card
    title='Markdown test'
    description='Just some random text to test markdown features.'
    href='/sample/markdown-test'
  />
  <Card
    title='MDX test'
    description='Same as markdown test but specifically for testing MDX components.'
    href='/sample/mdx-test'
  />
</Cards>
```

## Code blocks

Code blocks allow you to display code snippets with syntax highlighting, using [Shiki](https://shiki.style/). Each code block also includes a copy button to copy to code within it to the clipboard.

````mdx
```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prev => prev + 1)}>{count}</button>
    </>
  );
};
```
````

### Code block title

You can also add a title to a code block, such as a file name.

```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export const cn = (...inputs: ClassValue[]) => twMerge(clsx(inputs));
```

````mdx
```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export const cn = (...inputs: ClassValue[]) => twMerge(clsx(inputs));
```
````

## Steps

The `Steps` component renders a numbered set of steps, useful for displaying step-by-step instructions. It turns each `h3` heading within it into a step heading with a number.

<Steps>
### Do a thing

This thing is very important! You should do it.

### Do another thing

This other thing is not as important as the first one, but you should do it anyway.

### That's it lol

There isn't really a third thing to do, I just felt like having three steps here is better.

</Steps>

```mdx
<Steps>
### Do a thing

This thing is very important! You should do it.

### Do another thing

This other thing is not as important as the first one, but you should do it anyway.

### That's it lol

There isn't really a third thing to do, I just felt like having three steps here is better.

</Steps>
```

## Tabs

The `Tabs` component allows you to organize content into multiple tabs, displaying the content of one tab at a time.

<Tabs items={['Hello', 'World']}>
  <Tab>**Hello!**</Tab>
  <Tab>**World!**</Tab>
</Tabs>

```mdx
<Tabs items={['Hello', 'World']}>
  <Tab>**Hello!**</Tab>
  <Tab>**World!**</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Default selected tab

By default the first tab will be selected, however this can be changed using an optional `defaultIndex` prop.

```mdx
<Tabs items={['Hello', 'World']} defaultIndex={1}>
  <Tab>**Hello!**</Tab>
  <Tab>**World!**</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Shared value

You can also add an `id` prop to your tabs - this will allow storing the selected tab's value in `localStorage`, which would persist across page reloads.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs id='packageManager' items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```
    npx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    yarn dlx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    bunx --bun shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If multiple `Tabs` components with the same `id` exist on the same page, they will sync with each other!

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs id='packageManager' items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```
    npm install react-transition-switch
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    yarn add react-transition-switch
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    pnpm add react-transition-switch
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    bun add react-transition-switch
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
````mdx
<Tabs id='packageManager' items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```
    npx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    yarn dlx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    bunx --bun shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
````
