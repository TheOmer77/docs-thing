## Alerts

Alerts are an extension of the blockquote syntax that you can use to emphasize critical information, working similarly to [how they do on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). To turn a blockquote into an alert, simply start it with either `[!INFO]` for info alerts, or `[!DANGER]` for danger alerts.

```md
> [!INFO]
> This is an alert with some info.

> [!INFO] **Note**
>
> There should be some important info here. Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with any.

> [!DANGER]
> This is an alert with a warning or negative message.

> [!DANGER] **Warning!**
>
> This is the most dangerous alert you have ever seen. But not really.
```

### Examples
