The following components are available out of the box for use in MDX pages:

## Alerts

Alerts are an extension of the blockquote syntax that you can use to emphasize critical information, working similarly to [how they do on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). To turn a blockquote into an alert, simply start it with the correct prefix for the type you want.

### Types

#### Info

For info alerts, use the `[!INFO]` prefix:

```md
> [!INFO]
> This is an alert with some info.

> [!INFO] **Note**
>
> There should be some important info here. Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with any.
```

> [!INFO]
> This is an alert with some info.

> [!INFO] **Note**
>
> There should be some important info here. Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with any.

#### Danger

For danger alerts, use the `[!DANGER]` prefix:

```md
> [!DANGER]
> This is an alert with a warning or negative message.

> [!DANGER] **Warning!**
>
> This is the most dangerous alert you have ever seen. But not really.
```

> [!DANGER]
> This is an alert with a warning or negative message.

> [!DANGER] **Warning!**
>
> This is the most dangerous alert you have ever seen. But not really.

## Code blocks

Code blocks allow you to display code snippets with syntax highlighting, using [Shiki](https://shiki.style/). Each code block also includes a copy button to copy to code within it to the clipboard.

````mdx
```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prev => prev + 1)}>{count}</button>
    </>
  );
};
```
````

### Code block title

You can also add a title to a code block, such as a file name.

````mdx
```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export const cn = (...inputs: ClassValue[]) => twMerge(clsx(inputs));
```
````

This would render:

```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export const cn = (...inputs: ClassValue[]) => twMerge(clsx(inputs));
```
