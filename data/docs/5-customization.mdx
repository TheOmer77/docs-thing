## Site configuration

The `config.json` file in the `data/` directory defines various site-wide properties:

- `title` - Site title, appearing by default as the home page's `<title>`, as well as in the Nav's header.
- `titleTemplate` - Template for the `<title>` of pages.
- `links` - An array of links that will appear in the navbar, such as your git repo or social media. Each object in the array must be in the structure of:
  ```ts
  { href: string, label: string, type: string }
  ```
  In this example site the only type is `github`, but you can add additional types in `@/components/layout/nav/links.tsx`.
- `categories` - An object where keys are category IDs and values are display names, as described in the [categories page](/docs/categories).
