Pages can be nested under other pages (or "folders"), similar to a file structure, for a more organized and intuitive structure of content.

A page is considered nested if it's in a directory which also has an index page (`index.mdx`) - in that case, the index page is the parent, while all other pages in the directory are nested under it. A nested page is displayed under its parent alongside other pages in the same folder, if the parent page or any of its children is the currently viewed page. Otherwise, nested pages are hidden.

However, if a page is in a folder which does not have an index page, there is nothing to nest it under - and is therefore treated like all other pages, and just displayed at the top level on the sidebar. This can be useful for just having an organized file structure.

For example, in a folder called `nested` which is structured as shown below, `nested/index.mdx` serves as the main page for its directory, while the other pages are displayed under it.

```
nested
├─ index.mdx
├─ nested1.mdx
├─ nested2.mdx
└─ nested3.mdx
```

## Nesting & categories

Nested pages are always displayed under their parent in the sidebar. As such, it's not necessary to give them a category, and they are treated as if they have the same category as their parent index page.
