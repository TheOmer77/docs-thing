## Some React code

Here's some random React code, because I couldn't find anything better to put here:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prev => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>
      very long
    </div>
  );
};
```
