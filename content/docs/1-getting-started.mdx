**Docs thing** is a template for documentation sites, powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev/). It's designed to be fairly simple but easily extensible, though it does include some nice features out of the box.

## Set up the project

<Steps>
### Clone the Docs Thing repo

Start by cloning the repo for this template:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheOmer77/docs-thing.git
cd docs-thing
```

Alternatively, you can [create a new repo on GitHub from this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=docs-thing&template_owner=TheOmer77).

### Install dependencies

Use your favorite package manager to install the project's dependencies:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs id='packageManager' items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```
    npm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    bun install
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

> [!INFO] Note
>
> This project uses PNPM as its package manager. If you want to use a different one, remove `pnpm-lock.yaml` (your package manager will generate its own lockfile) and update the `packageManager` field in `package.json`.

### Run the development server

Use the `dev` script to run this project in development mode:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs id='packageManager' items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Start editing docs

You're now ready to go! Start creating docs in the project's `content` directory, and write content using markdown and MDX.

Next, you can learn how to [add metadata](/docs/page-meta) to your pages, [organize them](/docs/organization) or [use MDX components](/docs/components).

</Steps>

## Build your site

Once you're done writing content, you can build your site and host it wherever you want.

<Steps>
### Optional: Choose build output

Update the project's `next.config.mjs` file, adding an `output` with the value for your desired build output format:

- `'export'`: A static build in the `out` directory, including just HTML/CSS/JS files.
- `'standalone'`: A standalone build in the `.next/standalone` directory, useful if you want to host your site in a Docker container.

> [!INFO] Deploying to Vercel
>
> If you want to host your site on Vercel, you can skip this step and just leave `output` undefined.

### Build your site

Finally, run the `build` script to build your docs site:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs id='packageManager' items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    yarn build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    pnpm build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    bun run build
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Steps>
