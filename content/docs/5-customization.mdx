## Site configuration

The `config.json` file in the `content` directory defines various site-wide properties:

- `title` - Site title, appearing by default as the home page's `<title>`, as well as in the Nav's header.
- `titleTemplate` - Template for the `<title>` of pages.
- `links` - An array of links that will appear in the navbar, such as your git repo or social media. Each object in the array must be in the structure of:
  ```ts
  { href: string, label: string, type: string }
  ```
  In this example site the only type is `github`, but you can add additional types in `src/components/layout/nav/links.tsx`.
- `categories` - An object where keys are category IDs and values are display names, as described in the [organization page](/docs/organization#categories).

## Customize Content Collections

This site uses [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev/) to display MDX content. Two types of collections are used in its config file, which you can customize by updating their schemas.

- **Doc** - Documentation pages, containing MDX content. \
  `src/config/content-collections/doc.ts`
  - You can optionally customize Shiki for code blocks, at `src/config/content-collections/shiki.ts`
- **Site config** - The `content/config.json` global site configuration file described above. \
  `src/config/content-collections/site-config.ts`

If you want to add additional collection types (for example, blog pages) or just tweak the Content Collections options, you can edit its config file `content-collections.ts` at the root of this project.

## Add custom MDX components

In addition to the [available MDX components](/docs/components), you can add your own components to use in MDX pages.

<Steps>
### Create a component

First, create your component in `src/components/mdx/`.

```tsx title="src/components/mdx/custom-component.tsx"
export const CustomComponent = ({ children }: PropsWithChildren) => (
  <div>{children}</div>
);
```

### Add to MDX components

Add your custom component to the list of available MDX components.

```tsx title="src/components/mdx/index.tsx"
import { CustomComponent } from './custom-component';

export const mdxComponents = {
  // ...other components
  CustomComponent,
};
```

### Use your new component

Now your custom component is ready to use! You can use it in any MDX page.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx title="data/doc.mdx"
<CustomComponent>
  Content of your custom component goes here.
</CustomComponent>
```

</Steps>

## Customize... everything!

As this site is just a Next.js project, you can just customize everything in the `src` directory - including components, pages, styles and more. You can also customize config files outside of `src`.
