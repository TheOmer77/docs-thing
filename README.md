# Docs thing

This is a simple docs site powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Content Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev/).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The server will run at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Pages will auto-update in the browser as you edit them.
